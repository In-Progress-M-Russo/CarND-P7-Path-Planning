## Path Planning Project
The goal of this project is the implementation, in C++, of a path planning algorythm able to navigate a vehicle around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The car stays as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, passing slower traffic when possible. The path planner will avoid colliding with other cars and will keep the Ego vehicle inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The trajectories generated by the planner will also keep total acceleration below 10 m/s^2 and total jerk below than 10 m/s^3.

The source code is contained in the [src](./src) folder in this git repo. It is the evolution of a starter project provided directly by Udacity, where the [`main.cpp`](./src/main.cpp) file was modified and few files (most notably [`vehicle.cpp`](./src/vehicle.cpp) and [`vehicle.h`](./src/vehicle.h)) were added.

The following sections of this writeup will provide details on the filter operations and the data flow, and in doing so the fundamental pieces of the code will be explained. A final Results section will show the outcomes of the path planner running.

## Data Input

The data source for this Filter will be the Udacity [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2). The compiled code will open a websocket session to the sim to read localization information for the vehicles and provide back a trajectory to follow.

### _The Map_
A map of the highway is also provided in the [`highway_map.txt`](./data/highway_map.txt) file that can be found in the [data](./data) directory. 

Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

---
## Code Structure
The code in [`main.cpp`](./src/main.cpp) has been modified mostly regarding the `onMessage` lambda function that gets ionvoked when a new message is available through the WebSocket connection open with the simulator (lines 72-243):

```sh
    h.onMessage([&ref_vel, &max_s, &ego_state, &ego_goal_lane, &init_acc_over,
               &map_waypoints_x,&map_waypoints_y,&map_waypoints_s,
               &map_waypoints_dx,&map_waypoints_dy]
              (uWS::WebSocket<uWS::SERVER> ws, char *data, size_t length,
               uWS::OpCode opCode) {
               
               ...              
  }
```

Within this function there are few more steps that can be found.

## Message Parsing
This is just the parsing of the various items in the message coming from the sim: can be found in lines (92-114): 

```sh
    // ===================================================================
    // MESSAGE PARSING
    // Main car's localization Data
    double car_x = j[1]["x"];
    double car_y = j[1]["y"];
    double car_s = j[1]["s"];
    double car_d = j[1]["d"];
    double car_yaw = j[1]["yaw"];
    double car_speed = j[1]["speed"];

    // Previous path data given to the Planner and NOT yet executed by
    // the car
    vector<double> previous_path_x = j[1]["previous_path_x"];
    vector<double> previous_path_y = j[1]["previous_path_y"];
    // Previous path's end s and d values
    double end_path_s = j[1]["end_path_s"];
    double end_path_d = j[1]["end_path_d"];

     // Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other cars on the same side
     //   of the road.
     auto sensor_fusion = j[1]["sensor_fusion"];

     json msgJson;
```

## Path Planning
The actual Path Planning phase starts on line 117. 

Both the Ego vehicle and the others on the road will be represented through the `Vehicle` object defined in [`Vehicle.h`](./src/vehicle.h) and [`Vehicle.cpp`](./src/vehicle.cpp). The conditions of the vehicle on the road will be defined through 2 maps defined in `main.cpp` on lines (128-130):

```sh
   // Maps to be filled with the vehicles in the scene and their possible trajectories
   map<int, Vehicle> vehicles;
   map<int ,vector<Vehicle> > predictions;
```

The first one will be a snapshot of the vehicles as sensed, the second will contain some extrapolations of possible trajectories.

### _Vehicle class_


## Trajectory Definition
The definition of the trajectories makes use of what explained in the Udacity [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sI3VHFPP0w&feature=emb_logo) supporting the project.

## Results
Examples of the trajectories enabled by this path planner can be found in the following videos:

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.
